Your friendly neighborhood AI speaks like a true Canadian and can help you discover restaurants, attractions, directions, and more - all while being as polite as a Mountie and as warm as a Tim Hortons double-double!

## Features

üçÅ **Canadian Personality**: Your AI assistant speaks with authentic Canadian expressions and mannerisms
üó∫Ô∏è **Google Maps Integration**: Search for places, get directions, and find details about locations
üé§ **Voice Interaction**: Real-time voice conversations using OpenAI's Realtime API
üìç **Location-Aware**: Uses your current location to provide relevant recommendations
‚ö° **Real-Time**: Low-latency audio streaming for natural conversations

## Installation and Setup

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. An OpenAI API key - create one in the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. A Google Maps API key - get one from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/)

### Environment Setup

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Copy the example environment file and configure your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit `.env` and add your API keys:

```bash
# OpenAI API Key - Required for the Realtime API
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here

# Google Maps API Key - Required for places search functionality
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_google_maps_api_key_here

# Optional: Server port (defaults to 3000)
PORT=3000
```

### Google Maps API Setup

For the Google Maps integration to work, you need to enable these APIs in your Google Cloud Console:

1. **Places API** - For searching restaurants, attractions, etc.
2. **Geocoding API** - For converting addresses to coordinates
3. **Directions API** - For getting directions between locations

### Installation

Install dependencies for the application:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Canadian AI Places Assistant on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No audio**: Make sure to allow microphone access in your browser

3. **Google Maps errors**: Verify your API key and enabled APIs
4. **Session fails**: Check your OpenAI API key and account credits

### API Key Issues

- **OpenAI**: Make sure you have credits and the key has Realtime API access
- **Google Maps**: Ensure billing is enabled and the required APIs are activated
